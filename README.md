The following tasks were executed during the first stage of data cleaning and preparations:

EDA involved looking at the data to find important insights like:

### Data Analysis
---
Here, we included some of the DAX expressions used in the study along with a few simple lines of code or queries;
```SQL
SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Region;

SELECT TOP 1 SubscriptionType, COUNT(CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY TotalCustomers DESC;

SELECT [CustomerName]
FROM [dbo].[SUB DATA]
WHERE [Canceled] IS NOT NULL
  AND DATEDIFF(day,[SubscriptionStart] , [Canceled]) <= 180;

SELECT TOP 3 Region,
       COUNT(*) AS Cancellation_count
FROM [dbo].[SUB DATA]
WHERE [Canceled] IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Cancellation_count DESC;
```
