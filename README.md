### Project Overview
---
The purpose of this project work is to analyze customer data for a subscription service done in two years. This analysis helps to identify important trends and segments based on customer behaviors and also cancelations and renewals of subscriptions.Â

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
The following tasks were executed during the first stage of data cleaning and preparations:
1. Data loading and examination
2. Removal of Duplicate information in the data
3. Formatting and data cleaning

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involved looking at the data to find important insights like:
-What are the subscription types?
-What is the average subscription duration?
-What are the subscription patterns and trends?

### Data Analysis
---
Here, we included some of the DAX expressions used in the study along with a few simple lines of code or queries;
```SQL
SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Region;

SELECT TOP 1 SubscriptionType, COUNT(CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY TotalCustomers DESC;

SELECT [CustomerName]
FROM [dbo].[SUB DATA]
WHERE [Canceled] IS NOT NULL
  AND DATEDIFF(day,[SubscriptionStart] , [Canceled]) <= 180;

SELECT TOP 3 Region,
       COUNT(*) AS Cancellation_count
FROM [dbo].[SUB DATA]
WHERE [Canceled] IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Cancellation_count DESC;
```
